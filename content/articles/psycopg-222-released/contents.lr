What's new in psycopg 2.2.2
---------------------------

Bux fixes
^^^^^^^^^^

- the call to ``logging.basicConfig()`` in pool.py has been dropped: it
  was messing with some projects using logging (and a library should
  not initialize the logging system anyway.)
- psycopg now correctly handles time zones with seconds in the UTC
  offset. The old ``register_tstz_w_secs()`` function is deprecated and
  will raise a warning if called.
- Exceptions raised by the column iterator are propagated.
- Exceptions raised by ``executemany()`` interators are propagated.

| Have fun,
| federico
